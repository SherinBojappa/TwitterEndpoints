    "- The goal of this tutorial is to introduce how to convert rules from plain english into queries that can be used to filter your tweets.\n",
    "- Along with the use of some boolean logic you will be able to easily translate your requirements into targeted queries, that allow you to get desired results from twitter endpoints.\n",
    "- This tutorial is based on [PlainLanguageToRules](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tutorials/translating-plain-language-to-pt-rules) "
